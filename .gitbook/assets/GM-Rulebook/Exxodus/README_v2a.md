## 1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Exxodus is a card game where players compete to accumulate Value Points (VP) by controlling planets and other locations, establishing trade routes, building fleets, researching technologies, completing missions, and engaging in combat.  The game combines strategic resource management, tactical card play, and elements of exploration and discovery.

## 2. Game Components <a name="game-components"></a>

*   **Cards:**  Various types of cards, including Planets, Ships, Leaders, Technology, Missions, and expansion-specific cards (Resource Depots, Hyperstructures, Anomalies, Events, etc.).
*   **Credit Tokens:** Used for purchasing cards and taking certain actions.
*   **Research Point (RP) Tokens (Optional):**  Used for tracking progress on Research Projects and Stellar Projects.  Could be represented by small tokens or simply tracked on paper.
*   **Six-Sided Die (Optional):**  Used for certain card effects (e.g., Chronos Labyrinth).
*   **Player Boards (Recommended):** To help organize cards in play.

## 3. Setup <a name="setup"></a>

### 3.1 Core Game Setup <a name="core-game-setup"></a>

1.  **Card Decks:**
    *   Separate the cards into the following decks: Planets, Ships, Leaders, Tech, Missions.  *Do not shuffle these decks yet.*
    *   If using expansions, add the expansion cards to their corresponding decks *before* drafting (e.g., Resource Depots to the Planet deck, new Ships to the Ship deck, etc.).  Expansion-specific decks like Hyperstructures, Anomalies, Events, Alien Artifacts, Starbases, Research Projects, Stellar Projects, and Phenomena are *not* used in the initial draft and should be set aside.

2.  **Drafting:** Choose *one* of the following drafting methods:

    **Drafting Type A (For 2-3 players and a smaller card pool):**
    *   Combine the Planet, Ship, and Leader decks and shuffle them thoroughly.
    *   Deal each player 12 cards from this combined deck.
    *   Each player chooses 6 cards to keep and discards the rest.

    **Drafting Type B (For 4+ players or a larger card pool, including multiple expansions):**
    *   **Planets:** Deal each player 6 Planet cards. Each player chooses 2 to keep and discards the rest.
    *   **Ships:** Deal each player 5 Ship cards. Each player chooses 2 to keep and discards the rest.
    *   **Leaders:** Deal each player 3 Leader cards. Each player chooses 1 to keep and discards the rest.
    *   **Tech (Optional):** Deal each player 2 Tech cards. Each player chooses 1 to keep and discards the rest.
    *   **Missions (Optional):** Deal each player 2 Mission cards. Each player chooses 1 to keep and discards the rest.
    *   **Commanders:** If using Commanders, deal each player 3 Commander cards, and allow each player to choose one to keep and discard the rest.

    *   **Discards (All Types):** Put all discarded cards into a separate box (the "discard box"). These cards are not used for the rest of the game (unless a card effect specifically interacts with the discard box).

3.  **Shuffle:** After drafting, shuffle each of the remaining decks (Planets, Ships, Leaders, Tech, Missions) separately.
4.  **Resource Deck:** Create a single "Resource Deck" by combining the shuffled Ships, Tech, and Missions decks. This is the main draw deck for the game.
5.  **Starting Hand:** Each player draws 3 cards from the Resource Deck. (Consider increasing this to 4 if *not* doing a Tech/Mission draft in Type B).
6.  **Credits:** Each player starts with 5 credit tokens.
7.  **Starting Planets:** Each player places their chosen Planet cards face-up in front of them. This is their starting territory.
8.  **Starting Leader/Commander:** Each player places their chosen Leader or Commander card face-up in front of them.

### 3.2 Expansion Modules <a name="expansion-modules"></a>

Before setup, players should agree on which expansion modules to include.  Here's how to incorporate each one:

*   **Resource Depots:** Shuffle the Resource Depot cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Hyperstructures:** Shuffle the Hyperstructure cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Anomalies:** Shuffle the Anomaly cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Events:** Shuffle the Event cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Alien Zones:**
    *   *Before* dealing Planet cards, deal each player one Alien Zone card. This *replaces* one of their starting Planets.  Players should adjust their Planet draft accordingly (choose 2 Planets instead of 3).
    * Place the dealt Alien Zone card in the location, where would be placed planet.
*   **Alien Artifacts:** Shuffle the Alien Artifact cards and deal one to each player at the *beginning* of the game.  Players keep their Artifacts secret.
*   **Starbases:** Shuffle the Starbase cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Research Projects:** Shuffle the Research Project cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
* **Stellar Projects:** Shuffle the Stellar Projects cards and place them as a separate face-down deck.
*   **Phenomena:** Shuffle the Phenomenon cards and place them as a separate face-down deck. Reveal the top card of the Phenomenon deck â€“ this is the starting Phenomenon.
*  **Commanders:** Deal 3, allow players to choose one.

**Modular Gameplay:**  You can choose to play with any combination of these expansions.  For a simpler game, use only the core rules.  For a more complex and varied experience, include one or more expansions.

## 4. Gameplay <a name="gameplay"></a>

### 4.1 Player Turns <a name="player-turns"></a>

Players take turns in clockwise order.  At the *beginning* of each player's turn, they perform the following steps *in order*:

1.  **Draw Phase:** Draw one card from the Resource Deck.
2.  **Resource/Upkeep Phase:**
    *   Gain any passive income (credits from Resource Depots, card draws from certain abilities, etc.).
    *   Check for any triggered abilities that occur at the beginning of the turn (e.g., Research Project completion).
3.  **Action Phase:** Perform up to three actions (see [Actions](#actions)).
4.  **End Phase:**
    *   Check for any triggered abilities that occur at the end of the turn.
    *   If you have more than 5 cards in your hand, discard down to 5.

### 4.2 Actions <a name="actions"></a>

A player can perform up to **three actions** during their Action Phase. The available actions are:

*   **Play a Card:** Place a card from your hand into play (see [Placing Cards](#placing-cards)).  This costs 1 action + the card's VALUE (credit cost).
*   **Trade:** Establish a trade route between two locations (see [Trading](#trading-economics)). This costs a variable number of actions.
*   **Attack:** Initiate combat with an opponent's fleet, location, or Leader (see [Combat](#combat-fight)). This costs a variable number of actions.
*   **Move a Ship/Leader:** Move a Ship or Leader card between stacks.  This costs 1 action + the card's VALUE.
*   **Activate a Card Ability:** Some cards have abilities that require an action to activate.
*   **Discard a Card for Credit:** Discard a card from your hand to gain 1 credit. This costs 1 action.
*   **Generate Research Point:** Spend an action to add 1 RP to one of your Research Projects or Stellar Projects.
*   **Pass:**  Do nothing.

**Important Action Notes:**

*   A player can only perform the **Trade** action *once* per turn.
*   Other actions can generally be performed multiple times, as long as the player has enough actions and resources remaining.
* Some actions are unique and limited.

### 4.3 Placing Cards <a name="placing-cards"></a>

To play a card, a player must:

1.  Spend one action.
2.  Pay the card's VALUE (credit cost), unless the card's text states otherwise.

Cards can be played in various ways, depending on their type:

*   **Individually:** The card is placed on the table as a separate entity (e.g., a Commander, a standalone Leader).
*   **Into a Stack:** The card is added to an existing stack of cards (see [Card Stacks](#card-stacks)).
*   **Onto a Location:** Some cards (like Starbases, Anomalies) are played *onto* a Planet, Resource Depot, or Hyperstructure.
* **Face Down** Some cards are played facedown (Research, Stellar projects, etc.)

### 4.4 Card Stacks <a name="card-stacks"></a>

*   Cards of certain types (primarily Ships and Leaders) can be stacked together.  When cards are stacked, their statistics (POWER, SHIELD, TECH, DEF, etc.) are added together.
*   **Stack Limits:**
    *   A stack can contain a maximum of *one* Leader card.
    *   A stack can contain a maximum of *three* Ship cards.
    *   A location (Planet, Resource Depot, etc.) can have *one* Starbase built on it.
    * Hyperstructure, Planet, Resource depot or Station can have only *one* attached Tech.
*   Ships and Leaders can move *between* existing stacks. This costs 1 action and the card's VALUE.
*   "Double" card statistics affect the game with the numbers corresponding to the card owner.

### 4.5 Trading (Economics) <a name="trading-economics"></a>

Trading allows players to generate credits by transporting commodities between planets (and some other locations).

**Requirements for Trade:**

1.  **Merchant Fleet:** The player must have at least one Ship card (forming a Merchant Fleet) on the *origin* location.
2.  **Tradable Commodity:** The origin location must have a value *greater than 0* for the commodity being traded.  Some locations may have special rules affecting trade.
3.  **Two Locations:** Trade occurs between two locations (Planets, Resource Depots, Hyperstructures â€“ some locations may have restrictions).

**Trade Process:**

1.  **Action Cost:** The number of actions required for a trade is equal to the number of Ship cards in the Merchant Fleet on the origin location (up to a maximum of 3 actions).
2.  **Revenue Calculation:**
    *   Determine the value of the commodity being traded on the *origin* location.
    *   Add any bonuses from card abilities, Commanders, or other effects.
    *   Subtract any Docking Fees (paid to the owner of the *destination* location â€“ typically based on POP or special abilities).
    *   Subtract any other penalties or modifiers.
    *   The result is the player's profit in credits.

### 4.6 Combat (Fight) <a name="combat-fight"></a>

Combat occurs when a player chooses to attack an opponent's fleet, location, or Leader.

**Phases of Combat:**

1.  **Declaration of Fight:** The attacking player declares which of their Wings/Fleets (or single Leader card) is attacking, and what they are attacking. Only one Wing/Fleet per side can participate in a single fight.
2.  **Calculation of Fight:**
    *   **Power:** Calculate the attacking force's total POWER (sum of all cards in the stack, plus any modifiers).
    *   **Shield/Defense:** Calculate the defending force's total SHIELD (for fleets) or DEF (for locations)
    *   **Success:** If the attacking POWER is greater than or equal to the defending SHIELD/DEF, the attack is successful.
3.  **Fight Result:** Determine damage and remove cards from the game.

#### 4.6.1 Fleet Combat <a name="fleet-combat"></a>

*   **Speed:** The SPEED stat determines the order of attacks. A fleet with a higher SPEED attacks *before* a fleet with a lower SPEED. If a faster fleet destroys or damages the slower fleet, the slower fleet may not get to attack at all.
*   **Damaged Ships:** Ships that are damaged in combat *cannot attack*. Damaged ships are indicated by rotating the card.
*   **Wing/Fleet Speed:** The SPEED of a Wing/Fleet is determined by the *slowest* ship in the Wing.
* **Number of Ships in Wing:** The action cost of attack equals the number of ships.
*   **Repairing Ships:** Damaged ships can be repaired by moving them to a Planet you control. This costs actions and credits (like moving a ship). Some cards may also provide repair abilities.
*  Ships with speed 0 or less CAN NOT attack!

#### 4.6.2 Planet/Location Assault <a name="planetlocation-assault"></a>

*   Location assaults (attacking Planets, Resource Depots, Hyperstructures, etc.) are resolved similarly to fleet combat.
*   The location's DEF value is its base defense.
*   All cards stacked on or associated with the location (Starbases, Tech, Leaders, etc.) contribute their stats to the defense.
*   If the attack is successful and "damages" the location, the *defending player* chooses which upgrades (stacked cards or associated structures) to discard.
*   If a Planet has *no* remaining upgrades or defensive structures and is successfully attacked, ownership of the Planet card changes to the attacker.  Other location types may have specific rules for capture.

#### 4.6.3 Leader Duels <a name="leader-duels"></a>

*   Only a Leader card played *individually* (not part of a stack) can initiate a Leader duel (an "assassination" attempt).
*   A Leader duel costs 3 actions (the attacking player's entire turn).
*   In a Leader duel, *all* stats of both Leaders (CHAR, LEAD, AGILITY, including any modifiers) are added up.
*   The Leader with the higher total wins. The losing Leader is removed from the game.
*   If the totals are equal, *both* Leaders are removed.

A typical Exxodus card has the following elements:

*   **Card Type:** (Planet, Ship, Leader, Tech, Mission, Resource Depot, Hyperstructure, Anomaly, Event, etc.)
*   **Card Name:**
*   **Statistics:** Numerical values representing the card's attributes (e.g., POWER, SHIELD, TECH, DEF, POP, SPEED, CHAR, LEAD, AGILITY).  These vary depending on the card type.
*   **Special Ability:** A text box describing any special abilities the card has.
*   **VALUE:** The card's credit cost (to play it).
*   **Expansion Icon (Optional):**  A small icon to indicate which expansion the card belongs to (useful for modular play).
* **Double Card Indicator (Optional):** Indication, that card is "double" with special stats.

## 7. Winning the Game <a name="winning-the-game"></a>

The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:

1.  **Empty Resource Deck:** The Resource Deck is empty, and the last player finishes their turn.
2.  **Target Card Value:** A player reaches a combined VALUE of cards on their table of a predetermined amount (recommended 25).
3.  **Target Credit Value:** A player reaches a predetermined amount of credits (recommended 25).
4. **Special Win Condition:** A card or expansion introduces another way to achieve victory.

The winner is the player with the *most* Value Points (VP) at the end of the game. VP are calculated as follows:

*   **Card Value:** Sum the VALUE of all cards the player has in play (including Planets, Ships, Leaders, Tech, Resource Depots, Hyperstructures, completed Research Projects, and any other cards with a VALUE). *Do not include Anomalies, Events, or Phenomena.*
*   **Credits:** Every 5 credits remaining counts as 1 VP.
* **Mission Card Bonus** Check missions at the end of the game.

*Cards cannot be traded for credits after the game ends.*

## 8. Tournament Modifications (Optional) <a name="tournament-modifications-optional"></a>

These optional rules can be used to modify gameplay:

*   **Assault:** Destroyed ships return to the owner's hand.
*   **Cyberfusion:** All stats of a WING, *including SPEED*, are added together. If a WING is damaged, *all* ships in the WING are damaged.
*   **Conquest:** Only the values of Planets in play count towards the final score.
*   **Grant:** At the beginning of their turn, a player replenishes their hand from the RESOURCES deck to have at least 5 cards.
*   **Revolution:** Damaged ships *can* attack.

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <a name="frequently-asked-questions-faq"></a>

*   **Q: What happens if multiple players play effect cards simultaneously?**
    *   A: The player whose turn it is resolves their card effects first. If it's neither player's turn, and timing is critical, the players should agree on a resolution (or, as a last resort, remove all simultaneously played cards from the game - the "Time Paradox Rule").

* **Q: Timing of Special Abilities:** Unless stated otherwise, Special Abilities could be activated whenever it is stated in description.

* **Clarification Regarding "Double" Cards:** "Double" card's stats are read from the perspective of the player who *owns* the card.

* **Specific Rulings for Cards:** The .md document includes expanded examples and rules.

Enjoy the game!

Okay, I'll generate a new set of Exxodus cards, extrapolating from the existing theme and mechanics. I'll aim for variety and try to introduce some new, but compatible, concepts. I'll follow the same format as before. I'll create 20 cards (5 of each basic type would feel repetitive): 4 Planets, 4 Leaders, 6 Ships, 4 Tech, and 2 Missions. I am adding new keywords.
