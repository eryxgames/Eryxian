# Eryxian: Exxodus - Enhanced Design Document

## Core Philosophy
Build upon Exxodus's excellent foundation while addressing complexity, player agency, and engagement issues.

## Key Mechanical Improvements

### 1. Unified Location System
**Consolidate all location types into enhanced Planets with modular upgrades:**

- **Planets** remain core locations
- **Infrastructure Cards** (replacing separate Resource Depots/Starbases)
  - Mining Station: +2 credits/turn
  - Trade Hub: +1 to all trade values
  - Defense Grid: +3 DEF, immune to first attack each turn
  - Research Lab: Generate 1 RP/turn

### 2. Market Row Resource System
Replace shared deck drawing with dynamic market:
- 5 cards face-up from Resource deck
- Spend 1 action + credits to acquire any market card
- Market refreshes when cards taken
- Bottom card is always "free" (action only)

### 3. Graduated Action Economy
- **Early Game** (0-2 planets): 3 actions
- **Mid Game** (3-5 planets): 4 actions  
- **Late Game** (6+ planets): 5 actions
- Creates empire progression feel

### 4. Enhanced Player Interaction

#### Diplomatic System
- **Trade Agreements**: Mutual +1 credit bonus when trading with agreed player
- **Military Pacts**: Shared defense bonuses
- **Technology Sharing**: Access to each other's research

#### Competitive Elements
- **Influence Tokens**: Bid for turn order and market priority
- **Sector Control**: Bonus VP for controlling connected planet clusters
- **Dynamic Events**: Replace random events with player-triggered choices

### 5. Streamlined Combat
Keep speed-based system but clarify:
- **Initiative Phase**: Compare speeds, faster acts first
- **Damage Phase**: Apply damage simultaneously if speeds equal
- **Resolution Phase**: Remove destroyed units, apply effects

### 6. Victory Condition Refinement
**Multiple Victory Paths (choose one at game start):**
- **Expansion**: Control 7 planets
- **Economic**: Accumulate 30 credits + 15 VP from cards
- **Technological**: Complete 3 Research Projects
- **Military**: Destroy 10 opponent cards through combat

### 7. Quality of Life Improvements

#### Card Clarity
- **Simplified Iconography**: Clear symbols for all stats
- **Color Coding**: Each card type has distinct color scheme
- **Timing Windows**: Clear keywords for when abilities trigger

#### Turn Structure
1. **Upkeep**: Gain income, trigger start-of-turn effects
2. **Actions**: Perform actions (3-5 based on empire size)
3. **Market**: Refresh market if needed
4. **Cleanup**: Discard to hand limit, trigger end-of-turn effects

## New Card Design Philosophy

### Universal Keywords
- **Swift**: Can be played during any player's turn
- **Persistent**: Effect lasts until specifically removed
- **Unique**: Only one copy can be in play per player
- **Requires**: Clear prerequisite conditions

### Balanced Asymmetry
Each faction/commander provides:
- One economic bonus
- One military bonus  
- One unique ability
- One trade-off/weakness

## Example Enhanced Cards

### Planets
**New Terra**
- TECH: 2, DEF: 1, POP: 3
- VALUE: 3
- **Colonial Hub**: Can support one additional Infrastructure card
- **Trade Network**: +1 to all trade routes involving this planet

### Leaders  
**Admiral Kane Stryker**
- CHAR: +1, LEAD: +3, AGILITY: -1
- VALUE: 3
- **Fleet Coordination**: Your wings move as a group for 1 action
- **Tactical Genius**: +1 Power to all ships when defending

### Ships
**Quantum Interceptor** (S-CLASS)
- POWER: +2, SHIELD: +1, SPEED: +4
- VALUE: 3
- **Phase Jump**: Can attack any target regardless of location (once per turn)
- **Swift Strike**: If speed is highest, deal damage before opponent can respond

### Technology
**Wormhole Network**
- +2 TECH, +1 SPEED (to ships), VALUE: 4
- **Instant Transit**: Ships can move between any planets you control for free
- **Requires**: Control 3+ planets

### Infrastructure
**Orbital Shipyard**
- Can attach to any Planet
- VALUE: 3
- **Ship Production**: Pay 2 credits to put a ship from hand into play here
- **Repairs**: Damaged ships here are repaired at start of your turn

## Expansion Framework

### Core Set Integration
Include best elements from all expansions in base game:
- 6 Commanders (global abilities)
- Research Projects (3-4 basic ones)
- Infrastructure system
- Enhanced planet variety

### Modular Expansions
- **Alien Encounters**: Adds alien races, artifacts, and anomalies
- **Deep Space**: Exploration, phenomena, and discovery mechanics  
- **Corporate Wars**: Enhanced economic and diplomatic systems
- **Ancient Mysteries**: Archaeological sites and precursor technology

## Estimated Gameplay Impact

### Game Length
- Reduced from 90-120 minutes to 60-90 minutes
- Faster setup and resolution

### Strategic Depth
- Maintained complexity in decision space
- Reduced complexity in rules overhead

### Player Engagement
- More interaction through diplomacy and competitive elements
- Less downtime with streamlined turns
- Market system provides constant interesting choices

### Scalability
- 2-6 players with minimal rule changes
- Modular difficulty through commander selection
- Easy to teach core game, expansions add complexity gradually

## Development Priorities

1. **Prototype Core Set** with streamlined rules
2. **Playtest Market Row system** extensively  
3. **Balance Action Economy** across different empire sizes
4. **Refine Victory Conditions** for engaging endgames
5. **Create Clear Rulebook** with extensive examples

# Assessment and recommendations for Eryxian: Exxodus

## Strengths of Current Design

**Excellent Core Loop**: The action economy, stacking mechanics, and interconnected trade/combat/tech systems create meaningful strategic decisions.

**Thematic Coherence**: The space empire theme is well-integrated throughout all mechanics.

**Strategic Depth**: Multiple victory paths and the speed-based combat system are genuinely clever innovations.

**Modular Design**: The expansion system allows for scalable complexity.

## Key Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Streamline Core Complexity**
**Problem**: The game has accumulated significant rules overhead across expansions.

**Solution for Eryxian**: 
- Create a cleaner "Core Set" that integrates the best expansion elements
- Consolidate similar card types (e.g., merge Resource Depots functionality into enhanced Planets)
- Simplify the double card mechanic with clearer visual design

### 2. **Enhanced Player Agency**
**Problem**: Shared resource deck creates luck dependency.

**Improved Drafting System**:
```
Market Row System:
- 5 cards face-up from Resource deck
- Players can spend actions to "acquire" from market
- Refresh market when cards taken
- Maintains card variety while reducing pure luck
```

### 3. **Dynamic Action Economy**
**Problem**: Fixed 3 actions may feel restrictive late game.

**Eryxian Action System**:
- Base 3 actions per turn
- Gain +1 action for every 3 planets controlled (max +2)
- Some cards provide "free actions" for specific activities
- Creates meaningful empire-building progression

### 4. **Improved Player Interaction**## Strategic Recommendations for Eryxian: Exxodus

### **Core Design Pillars**

1. **"Streamlined Depth"**: Reduce rules complexity while maintaining strategic decision space
2. **"Player Agency"**: Replace luck elements with meaningful choices  
3. **"Dynamic Progression"**: Empire growth should feel impactful on gameplay
4. **"Meaningful Interaction"**: More ways for players to affect each other beyond just combat

### **Highest Impact Changes**

**Market Row System** (Highest Priority)
- Eliminates the luck problem of shared deck draws
- Creates constant interesting decisions
- Maintains card variety and surprise

**Dynamic Action Economy** 
- Makes empire expansion feel meaningful
- Addresses pacing issues in late game
- Creates natural game progression

**Unified Location System**
- Simplifies the overwhelming array of location types
- Makes infrastructure upgrades more intuitive
- Reduces rules overhead significantly

### **Preservation Priorities**

Keep these excellent elements unchanged:
- **Speed-based combat system** (genuinely innovative)
- **Card stacking mechanics** (creates tactical depth)
- **Multiple victory paths** (supports different strategies)
- **Thematic integration** (very strong worldbuilding)

The goal is to create a game that feels like "Exxodus perfected" rather than a completely different system. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these recommendations or explore particular mechanical details further?
