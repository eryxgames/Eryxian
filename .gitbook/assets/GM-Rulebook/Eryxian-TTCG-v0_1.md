# (Part 1: Game Master's Guide)

**Introduction:**

The Eryxian TTRPG is a tabletop role-playing game set in the dynamic and dangerous Eryxian universe. It blends elements of science fiction, Westerns, horror, and dark satire, emphasizing player agency, emergent storytelling, and exploration of a world filled with ancient mysteries, conflicting factions, and unpredictable phenomena. This guide provides the core mechanics and principles for running engaging and memorable Eryxian campaigns.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Flexibility and Modularity:** The system is designed to be adaptable to different play styles and campaign types. Use the provided rules as a framework, and feel free to modify or expand upon them to suit your group's preferences.
*   **Emergent Storytelling:** Encourage player choices and actions to have meaningful consequences, shaping the narrative in unexpected ways.
*   **Eryxian Flavor:** Embrace the unique aspects of the setting – the layered atmosphere, the Scorched Cycles, the diverse factions, the ancient mysteries, and the "weirdness" of Eryxian life.
*   **Cards as Inspiration:** Utilize the optional card game components (Eryxian Creatures, Civilizations, Cargo, etc.) as *prompts* and *triggers* for events, encounters, and challenges, rather than as rigid rules.
*   **The Unknown:** Leave some questions unanswered. Embrace the mystery and ambiguity of the Eryxian universe.

**Core Mechanics:**

*   **Action Resolution:** Attribute + Skill + 1d10 vs. Target Number (TN).
    *   **Attributes:** Physique (PHY), Agility (AGI), Wits (WIT), Resolve (RES), Presence (PRE), Tech (TEC). Range: 1-4 (for starting characters).
    *   **Skills:** Specific areas of expertise (e.g., Melee: Swords, Ranged: Rifles, Stealth, Hacking, etc.). Range: 0-3 (Expertise Dice).
    *   **Expertise Dice:** Skills grant *Expertise Dice* (d6s of a different color) that *always* count as successes.
    *   **Roll:** Roll Attribute dice (d6). Add Expertise Dice (automatic successes). Successes are 4+.
    *   **Difficulty:** Easy (TN 4), Moderate (TN 5), Challenging (TN 6), Difficult (TN 7), Heroic (TN 8), Near Impossible (TN 9+).
    *   **Advantage/Disadvantage:** Roll an extra attribute die, keep best/worst result.
    *   **Critical Success:** Exceed required successes by 2+, *and* roll at least one 6 on Attribute dice.
    *   **Critical Failure:** No successes, *and* roll at least one 1 on Attribute dice.
    *   **Defense:** Active Defense roll (AGI + Dodge/Parry) as an opposed roll *or* Armor provides damage reduction, or increases TN.
*   **Plot Points:** A shared resource that players can spend to:
    *   Add a bonus to their die roll.
    *   Reroll the die.
    *   Activate special abilities.
    *   Influence the narrative (with GM approval).
    *   Draw a card from the "Twist of Fate" deck.
*   **Speed:** Represents a character's reflexes, agility, and ability to react quickly. Characters can spend Speed Points (equal to their Speed attribute) to add to their total *after* the die roll.
*   **Stunts:** Players can declare a "stunt" before rolling, describing a specific maneuver or action. This increases the difficulty and requires spending Speed Points, but grants a bonus effect if successful.

**GM Tools:**

*   **"Twist of Fate" Deck:** A deck of cards (or a random table) that introduces unexpected events, challenges, and opportunities.
*   **Faction Decks:** Cards representing the units, technologies, and resources of different factions (optional).
*   **Location Decks:** Cards representing different locations on Eryxia and beyond (optional).
*   **Character Decks:** Cards representing individual character abilities and equipment (optional).
*   **Random Tables:** Tables for generating encounters, locations, events, loot, and plot hooks.
*   **Scenario Outlines:** Pre-written adventure outlines that can be adapted to different play styles and group preferences.
*   **Bestiary:** Descriptions and stats for Eryxian creatures.
*   **Technology Guide:** Descriptions and stats for weapons, armor, vehicles, and other equipment.

**Running the Game:**

1.  **Establish the Scene:** Describe the setting, the characters, and the initial situation.
2.  **Present Challenges:** Introduce obstacles, conflicts, and dilemmas that the players must overcome.
3.  **Player Actions:** Allow players to describe what their characters do, using their skills and resources.
4.  **Action Resolution:** Use the core mechanic (Attribute + Skill + 1d10 vs. TN) to determine the outcome of actions.
5.  **Incorporate Cards (Optional):** Use cards from the "Twist of Fate" deck or other decks to introduce unexpected events, challenges, or opportunities.
6.  **Narrate the Results:** Describe the consequences of the players' actions, using vivid language and sensory details.
7.  **Repeat:** Continue the cycle of challenge, action, and resolution, adapting to the players' choices and the unfolding narrative.

**Remember:** The rules are a framework, not a straitjacket. Be flexible, be creative, and prioritize fun and engagement. Embrace the "weirdness" of Eryxia, and let the players shape their own destinies in this dynamic and dangerous universe.

This two-part document provides a concise and accessible overview of the Eryxian TTRPG's core mechanics and setting. It's designed to be easy to understand for both new players and experienced GMs, while still conveying the unique flavor and complexity of the Eryxian universe. It also emphasizes the flexibility of the system and encourages both players and GMs to customize the game to their own preferences. It is ready to be a base for the game, with further modifications.

# GM Support: Pre-Alpha Version Outline

TTRPG isn't *just* about the core mechanics; it's about the entire experience, including the setting, the presentation, and the tools provided to GMs and players. 

**I. Engaging Players (Beyond Mechanics):**

To create a *good and successful* game system that truly engages players, we need to go beyond just functional rules and consider:

1.  **Thematic Resonance:** The mechanics, setting, and character options should all reinforce the *themes* of the Eryxian universe. We've identified several key themes (Illusion of Control, Price of Progress, etc.). Every aspect of the game should contribute to exploring these themes.
2.  **Character Investment:** Players need to feel invested in their characters. This goes beyond just stats and skills. We need to provide:
    *   **Meaningful Choices:** Decisions that have real consequences, both in terms of the game mechanics and the narrative.
    *   **Opportunities for Roleplaying:** Encourage players to develop their characters' personalities, motivations, and relationships.
    *   **Backstory Hooks:** Provide options for players to create compelling backstories that tie their characters to the Eryxian universe.
    *   **Advancement Beyond Stats:** Consider ways for characters to grow and change that aren't just about increasing numbers (e.g., gaining new contacts, uncovering secrets, developing relationships, achieving personal goals).
3.  **Sense of Wonder and Mystery:** The Eryxian universe is full of strange phenomena, ancient mysteries, and unexplored territories. The game should encourage exploration, discovery, and a sense of wonder.
4.  **Player Agency:** Players should feel like they have a real impact on the world. Their choices should matter, and their actions should have consequences. Avoid "railroading" (forcing players down a predetermined path).
5.  **Variety of Play Styles:** The system should support different types of gameplay (combat, exploration, social interaction, investigation, etc.).
6.  **"Cool Factor":** The game should have elements that are simply *cool* – unique weapons, exciting abilities, bizarre creatures, intriguing locations. This helps to create a memorable and engaging experience.
7.  **Accessibility:** The rules should be easy to learn, but with enough depth to offer strategic choices and long-term engagement.
8. **Playable and replayable**:

**II. Maps and Labyrinths:**

*   **Maps (Starmaps and Planetary Maps):**
    *   **Starmaps:** *Essential* for establishing the larger context of the Eryxian universe. A starmap of the GW Orionis system, showing the location of Eryxia, other planets, space stations, and jump points, is a must-have. This can be included in the core rulebook.
        *   **Style:** Consider a stylized, slightly "retro" aesthetic, reminiscent of classic sci-fi maps.
        *   **Functionality:** The starmap can be used for navigation, planning expeditions, and tracking the movement of factions.
        *   **"Fog of War":** Parts of the starmap could be initially hidden or obscured, representing unexplored regions or areas of uncertainty.
    *   **Planetary Maps (Eryxia and Others):** A general map of Eryxia is crucial, showing the major biomes, regions (Verdant Expanse, Shifting Dunes, etc.), and known settlements. This map should:
        *   **Highlight Key Locations:** Mark important locations like mining outposts, research stations, Labyrinths, and areas of conflict.
        *   **Be Incomplete:** Leave large areas of the map unexplored or vaguely defined, encouraging exploration and discovery.
        *   **Be *Inaccurate* (Potentially):** Reflect the challenges of mapping Eryxia (shifting landscapes, atmospheric interference, etc.). The map could even be deliberately misleading, reflecting the biases or limited knowledge of the cartographers.
    *   **Local Maps:** For specific scenarios, the GM can create (or use pre-generated) local maps of specific areas (a mining complex, a jungle region, a Scavenger town, etc.).
*   **Labyrinths:**
    *   **Random Generation:** The GM book should provide guidelines and tables for *randomly generating* Labyrinth layouts. This ensures that each Labyrinth is unique and unpredictable.
    *   **Modular Design:** The Labyrinth generation system should be modular, allowing GMs to create Labyrinths of different sizes, complexities, and themes.
    *   **Key Features:** Labyrinths should include:
        *   **Shifting Passages:** Rules for how the Labyrinth changes over time.
        *   **Traps and Hazards:** Environmental dangers, creatures, and Ancient defenses.
        *   **Anomalies:** Temporal distortions, energy fields, and other strange phenomena.
        *   **Clues and Secrets:** Hidden messages, artifacts, or information about the Ancients.
        *   **A "Center" or "Goal":** A specific location or objective within the Labyrinth.
    *   **Visual Aids:** Consider including examples of Labyrinth layouts, glyphs, and room descriptions in the GM book.
    * **Card based:**

**III. GM Tools and Resources:**

*   **Scenario Outlines:** (As discussed previously) Provide a variety of scenario outlines, adaptable to different play styles and incorporating the various game elements.
*   **NPC Generator:** Tables or guidelines for quickly creating interesting and believable NPCs, with motivations, relationships, and potential secrets.
*   **Creature Generator:** Tables or guidelines for creating unique Eryxian creatures, with stats, abilities, and behaviors.
*   **Technology Generator:** Tables or guidelines for creating new weapons, equipment, and gadgets, reflecting the diverse technological landscape of the Eryxian universe.
*   **"Whispers and Rumors" Table:** A table of rumors, legends, and half-truths that the GM can use to introduce plot hooks, mysteries, and red herrings.
*   **"Consequences" Table:** A table of potential consequences for player actions, both positive and negative, to help the GM improvise and create a dynamic world.

**Putting it all together:**
The game should offer many options for all kind of players.
* Exploration, survival, combat, social, all this should be playable in the game, but a good game master can put accent of gameplay to a desired style.

By providing a robust set of tools and resources for both players and GMs, we can create a TTRPG that is not just a game, but a portal to a living, breathing, and constantly evolving universe. The focus should be on empowering *creativity* and *emergent storytelling*, allowing players to shape their own destinies within the rich and dangerous world of Eryxia. The maps, the Labyrinth generation system, and the random tables are all designed to *inspire* the GM and players, not to restrict them.
