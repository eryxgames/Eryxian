# Rulebook Outline

The Game Master (GM) book should absolutely provide scenario outlines that cater to different combinations of card packs (or lack thereof), offering maximum flexibility and replayability:

**GM Book Structure (Relevant Sections):**

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Overview of the Eryxian universe.
    *   Explanation of the core game mechanics (shared across all play styles).
    *   Explanation of the different play styles (TTRPG, card game, integrated).
    *   Guidance on choosing the right play style for your group.

2.  **Core Rules (TTRPG):**
    *   Character creation.
    *   Attribute and skill descriptions.
    *   Action resolution mechanics (using dice, cards, or diceless).
    *   Basic combat rules.
    *   Basic exploration rules.
    *   Basic social interaction rules.
    *   Resource management.
    *   Experience and advancement.

3.  **Eryxian Setting Guide:**
    *   Detailed descriptions of key locations, factions, creatures, and technologies.
    *   Information on Eryxian history, culture, and mysteries.
    *   This section should be *system-agnostic* – usable regardless of which game components are available.

4.  **Scenario Outlines:**
    *   This is the *crucial* section for adaptability.
    *   Each scenario outline should include:
        *   **Title:** A catchy and evocative title.
        *   **Synopsis:** A brief overview of the scenario's plot and objectives.
        *   **Setting:** The specific location(s) where the scenario takes place.
        *   **Factions Involved:** Which factions are involved, and what are their motivations?
        *   **Key NPCs:** Descriptions of important non-player characters.
        *   **Potential Challenges:** Obstacles, enemies, and dilemmas the players might face.
        *   **Possible Rewards:** What can the players gain from completing the scenario?
        *   **Twist (Optional):** A suggested twist or unexpected development.
        *   **Variations:** This is the *key* to adaptability. Each scenario should include variations for:
            *   **TTRPG Only:** How to run the scenario using *only* the core TTRPG rules (no cards).
            *   **TTRPG + Eryxian Creatures:** How to integrate the *Eryxian Creatures* card pack.
            *   **TTRPG + Eryxian Civilizations:** How to integrate the *Eryxian Civilizations* card pack/board game.
            *   **TTRPG + Eryxian Cargo:** How to integrate the *Eryxian Cargo* card pack.
            *   **TTRPG + Gordian Moon:** How to integrate the *Gordian Moon* card pack.
            *   **TTRPG + All Expansions:** How to run the scenario with *all* available components.
        *   **Scaling:** Guidance on how to adjust the difficulty of the scenario for different numbers of players and different character levels.

5.  **Random Tables:**
    *   For purely pen-and-paper play (or to supplement the card games), the GM book should include a variety of random tables to generate:
        *   Encounters (creatures, NPCs, environmental hazards).
        *   Locations (descriptions of different rooms, areas, or planets).
        *   Events (unexpected occurrences, challenges, or opportunities).
        *   Loot (weapons, equipment, resources, artifacts).
        *   Plot Hooks (ideas for starting new adventures).
    *   These tables should be designed to be evocative and flavorful, reinforcing the unique atmosphere of the Eryxian universe.

6.  **GM Advice:**
    *   Tips on running engaging and immersive Eryxian campaigns.
    *   Guidance on adapting the rules to different play styles.
    *   Advice on creating custom content (scenarios, NPCs, creatures, etc.).
    *   Suggestions for incorporating real-world science and philosophical concepts.

**Randomness in Pure Pen-and-Paper Play:**


1.  **Dice-Based Tables (Recommended):** This is the classic TTRPG solution. The GM book can include extensive random tables, categorized by environment, faction, threat level, etc.
    *   **Example:** A "Jungle Encounter Table" might have entries like:
        *   **Roll 2d6:**
            *   **2:** Giant Leech (stats provided elsewhere)
            *   **3-4:** Pack of Beta Rippers (stats provided elsewhere)
            *   **5-7:** Hostile Scavenger patrol (stats provided elsewhere)
            *   **8:**  Unusual atmospheric phenomenon (see "Environmental Hazards Table")
            *   **9-11:** Abandoned Dominion research outpost (see "Location Descriptions")
            *   **12:**  Whispering Glade (see special locations)
    *   **Use a variety of dice:** d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and even d100 (percentile dice) can be used to create tables with different probability distributions.
    *   **Layered Tables:** You can create tables that reference other tables, adding more depth and complexity. (e.g., "Roll on the Creature Encounter Table, then roll on the Creature Behavior Table.")

2.  **Mobile App (Optional but Powerful):** A companion app (for iOS and Android) could provide a more sophisticated random generation system.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Can handle more complex calculations and probabilities.
        *   Can generate more varied and dynamic encounters.
        *   Can incorporate images, sounds, and other multimedia elements.
        *   Can be updated with new content over time.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Requires development time and resources.
        *   Not strictly "pen-and-paper" anymore.

3.  **Card Deck Substitute (Printable):** The GM book could include printable pages that can be cut out to create a basic deck of cards, representing common encounters, events, and locations. This is a low-tech, but effective, solution.



# **Key Design Philosophies (Cards as Enhancement):**

*   **Cards as Prompts, Not Prescriptions:** The cards should *inspire* the GM and players, not dictate every detail of the game. They should provide options, suggestions, and starting points, but leave room for improvisation and narrative flexibility.
*   **Focus on "Triggers" and "Consequences":** Instead of directly resolving actions with cards (e.g., "Play this card to attack"), cards can act as *triggers* for events or *consequences* of player choices.
*   **GM Empowerment:** The GM always has the final say. The cards are a tool to help them create a dynamic and engaging story, not a replacement for their judgment and creativity.
*   **Blending, Not Replacing:** The card mechanics should *blend* seamlessly with the core TTRPG mechanics (dice rolls, skill checks, etc.), not replace them.
*   **Optional Complexity:** Offer different ways to use the cards, ranging from simple (draw a card for a random encounter) to complex (build a deck representing your faction's resources and strategies).

**Specific Mechanics and Implementations:**

1.  **The "Twist of Fate" Deck (Core Mechanic):**
    *   **Concept:** A core deck of cards (perhaps with a unique back, or simply called the "Eryxian Deck") that represents the unpredictable nature of the universe. This deck is used *in addition to* the core TTRPG resolution mechanic (dice rolls, etc.).
    *   **Card Types:** This deck would include a mix of:
        *   **Challenges:** Cards that introduce unexpected obstacles, complications, or enemies. (e.g., "Sudden Sandstorm," "Eryxian Ambush," "Equipment Malfunction")
        *   **Opportunities:** Cards that offer unexpected advantages, resources, or allies. (e.g., "Hidden Cache," "Local Guide," "Favorable Wind")
        *   **Discoveries:** Cards that reveal new information, clues, or locations. (e.g., "Ancient Map Fragment," "Whispers from the Past," "Unexplained Anomaly")
        *   **Twists:** Cards that introduce unexpected plot twists or complications. (e.g., "Betrayal," "Hidden Agenda," "Temporal Distortion")
        *   **Wildcards:** Cards with open-ended effects that the GM can interpret and adapt to the current situation.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   **At Key Moments:** The GM can draw a card from the Twist of Fate deck at key moments in the story (e.g., when the players enter a new location, make a major decision, or roll a critical failure).
        *   **Player Choice:** Players might be given the option to draw a card, accepting the risk/reward.
        *   **Resource-Driven:** Players might spend a resource (e.g., Plot Points, a special item) to draw a card or to *avoid* drawing a card.

2.  **Faction Decks (Strategic Layer):**

    *   **Concept:** Each major faction (Dominion, Utopians, Collective, Scavengers, Eryxians) has its own deck of cards representing its unique units, technologies, tactics, and resources.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   **Large-Scale Conflicts:** These decks can be used to resolve large-scale battles or strategic conflicts *abstractly*, providing a framework for the GM to narrate the outcome.
        *   **Resource Management:** Players controlling a faction can use these cards to manage their resources, deploy units, and develop technologies.
        *   **Asymmetrical Gameplay:** Each faction deck would have a different focus and play style, reflecting the faction's strengths and weaknesses.

3.  **Location Decks (Exploration and Discovery):**

    *   **Concept:** Each major region of Eryxia (or other planets) has its own deck of cards, representing the unique locations, encounters, and challenges within that region.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   **Exploration:** As players explore a region, the GM can draw cards from the relevant location deck to generate encounters, discoveries, and obstacles.
        *   **Dynamic Environments:** The cards can represent the changing nature of Eryxia (e.g., the Scorched Cycle, shifting Labyrinths).
        *   **Procedural Generation:** The cards can be used to create a sense of procedurally generated content, making each playthrough unique.

4.  **Character Decks (Personalized Options):**

    *   **Concept:** Each player character (or perhaps each character *archetype*) has a small deck of cards representing their unique skills, abilities, equipment, and background.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   **Special Abilities:** Players can play these cards to activate special abilities or gain advantages in specific situations.
        *   **Character Development:** Players can acquire new cards for their deck as they progress through the game, representing character growth and new skills.
        *   **Customization:** Players can customize their decks to reflect their character's unique play style.

5. **Combining Cards and Dice (Example):**

    * The TTRPG uses a dice pool system.
    *   A player wants to sneak past a Dominion patrol.
    *   The GM draws a "Twist of Fate" card: "Hidden Threat – A pack of Rippers is lurking nearby."
    *   The player rolls their Dexterity + Stealth dice pool.
    *   The GM describes the challenge, incorporating the Rippers.
    *   The player succeeds on their roll, but the GM decides that the Rippers are still alerted by the *scent* (a consequence of the card).
    *   The player *could* have played a "Smokescreen" card from their character deck to mask their scent, but they chose not to (or didn't have the card).
    *   The encounter escalates into a combat situation, but the player's initial success might give them a slight advantage.

**Key Takeaway:**

The cards should *augment* the TTRPG experience, not replace it. They should be a tool for the GM and players to create dynamic, unpredictable, and engaging stories, while still allowing for the freedom and flexibility of a traditional pen-and-paper RPG. The "Twist of Fate" deck is a particularly powerful tool for introducing unexpected events and challenges, keeping both the players and the GM on their toes. The faction, location, and character decks add layers of strategic depth and customization.

Okay, let's explore the implications of using cards from different releases (with potentially different backs) within a single TTRPG session, and how to design a turn-based game around that concept. This is a fascinating challenge, blending elements of deck-building, resource management, and tactical combat within a narrative framework.


# **Turn-Based Game Structure (with Multiple Decks):**

Here's a potential structure for a turn-based game incorporating multiple card decks (different backs), suitable for use within a TTRPG session:

1.  **Setup:**
    *   **Scenario:** The GM defines the scenario, based on the current situation in the TTRPG campaign. This could be a combat encounter, an exploration challenge, a social interaction, or a combination of these.
    *   **Deck Selection:** The GM (or the players, depending on the scenario) selects which card decks will be used. For example:
        *   A combat-focused scenario might use the "Creatures," "Units," and "Tactics" decks.
        *   An exploration scenario might use the "Locations," "Events," and "Resources" decks.
        *   A social scenario might use the "Characters," "Events," and "Factions" decks.
    *   **Starting Resources:** Players start with a certain amount of "Plot Points" (the shared resource) and potentially other resources based on their TTRPG characters' skills and equipment.
    *   **Objective:** The GM defines the objective of the scenario (e.g., defeat all enemies, explore a location, secure a resource, negotiate a treaty).

2.  **Player Turns:**
    *   **Draw Phase:** Players draw a set number of cards from one or more of the selected decks. The GM might dictate which decks can be drawn from, or allow players to choose.
    *   **Resource Phase:** Players gain Plot Points (and potentially other resources) based on their characters' skills, controlled locations, or other factors.
    *   **Action Phase:** Players can take a variety of actions, spending Plot Points to:
        *   **Play Cards:** Play Unit cards to engage in combat, Location cards to explore new areas, Event cards to trigger special effects, etc.
        *   **Activate Abilities:** Use character abilities or special card effects.
        *   **Purchase Cards:** Spend Plot Points to acquire new cards from a shared "market" or discard pile (adding a deck-building element).
        *   **Move Units:** If using a board or map, move their units across the game area.
    *   **Resolution Phase:** Resolve any conflicts or challenges, using the cards' stats (A, B, C) and potentially dice rolls or other TTRPG mechanics.
    *   **End Phase:** Discard cards, check for victory/defeat conditions, and prepare for the next turn.

3.  **GM Role:**
    *   **Narrative Framing:** The GM provides the narrative context for the card game, describing the setting, the characters, and the stakes.
    *   **Adjudication:** The GM interprets the rules, resolves any ambiguities, and makes rulings on card interactions.
    *   **Storytelling:** The GM uses the outcome of the card game to drive the TTRPG narrative forward, describing the consequences of the players' actions and introducing new challenges.
    *   **NPCs and Enemies:** The GM can control NPCs and enemies, playing cards from a separate deck or using pre-determined stats.
    *   **Environmental Effects:** The GM can introduce environmental effects or hazards, based on the setting and the cards played.

**Simulated Game Turn (Example):**

Let's imagine a scenario where a group of TTRPG characters (a Scavenger crew) are exploring a newly discovered Eryxian Labyrinth. The GM decides to use the "Locations," "Events," and "Creatures" decks.

*   **Setup:**
    *   **Scenario:** Explore the Labyrinth and find a rumored Ancient artifact.
    *   **Decks:** Locations (representing different chambers and passages within the Labyrinth), Events (representing challenges, discoveries, and traps), Creatures (representing Eryxian lifeforms guarding the Labyrinth).
    *   **Starting Resources:** Each player starts with 5 Plot Points.
    *   **Objective:** Reach the "Central Chamber" Location card and retrieve the "Artifact" Event card.

*   **Player 1's Turn:**
    *   **Draw Phase:** Draws 2 Location cards and 1 Event card.
    *   **Resource Phase:** Gains 2 Plot Points (based on their character's Exploration skill).
    *   **Action Phase:**
        *   Plays a "Narrow Passageway" Location card (Cost: 1 Plot Point). Describes entering a constricted section of the Labyrinth.
        *   Plays an "Energy Surge" Event card (Cost: 2 Plot Points). The GM describes a sudden burst of energy that damages the player's equipment (reducing a stat on one of their character's cards).
        *   Chooses *not* to engage a "Whisperer" Creature card in their hand, as they don't have enough Plot Points to activate its special ability.
    *   **Resolution Phase:** The GM describes the effects of the Energy Surge. No combat occurs.
    *   **End Phase:** Discards down to a hand limit of 5 cards.

*   **GM's Turn:**
    *   The GM plays a "Shifting Passages" Event card, forcing the player to discard a Location card and draw a new one.
    *   The GM plays a "Guardian Creature" card from their hand, placing it on the "Narrow Passageway" Location card.

*   **Player 2's Turn:** (And so on…)

**Key Considerations for Card Stats (A, B, C, Cost):**

*   **Flexibility:** The stats should be adaptable to different types of gameplay. For example:
    *   **Combat:** A = Attack, B = Defense, C = Special Ability (or Speed/Range)
    *   **Exploration:** A = Investigation, B = Resilience (to hazards), C = Movement/Stealth
    *   **Social:** A = Intimidation/Persuasion, B = Deception, C = Agility
*   **Cost (Plot Points):** This is your primary balancing mechanism. More powerful cards should have higher Plot Point costs.
*   **Synergies:** Design cards that have synergistic effects with each other, encouraging players to build strategic decks.
*   **Faction Differentiation:** Different factions should have access to different types of cards, reflecting their strengths and weaknesses.

**Example Card Ideas:**

*   **Unit (ExoSoldier):** A: 3, B: 4, C: 2, Cost: 3. Ability: "Suppression Fire: Reduce the Defense of one target Unit by 1."
*   **Location (Eryxian Jungle):** A: 1, B: 3, C: 2. Effect: "Draw 1 Event card when this Location is explored."
*   **Event (Energy Surge):** Cost: 2. Effect: "All Units take 2 damage. Discard 1 Resource card."
*   **Resource (Xantrium):** Effect: "Gain 3 Plot Points."
*   **Technology (Advanced Scanner):** Cost: 4. Effect: "Increase the range of your exploration actions by 2."
*   **Character (Scavenger Leader):** A: 2, B: 2, C: 4, Cost: 5. Ability: "Once per turn, you may discard a card to draw two cards."

This  framework provides a solid starting point for designing a holistic game system that integrates TTRPG, card game, and board game elements within the Eryxian universe. The key is to maintain a consistent underlying logic and to develop mechanics that are both engaging and thematic. We prioritize modularity and GM flexibility to allow for a wide range of play styles and **campaign** types.
