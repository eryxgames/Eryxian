# ðŸ“ª Eryxian Civilizations Card Game: Print & Play Edition

Welcome, Commander! This guide will help you get the Print & Play (PnP) Edition of Eryxian Civilizations onto your tabletop.

## Step 1: Obtain the Files

*   **Download:** Get the latest PnP package (including rulebook PDF, card sheets, token sheets, and any other necessary files) from:
    *   **[Our Official itch.io Page](https://eryxgames.itch.io/eryxian-civilizations)** (Recommended for the latest curated version)
    *   The [`/PrintAndPlay_CardGame`](./PrintAndPlay_CardGame) directory in this GitHub repository (may contain development versions).

## Step 2: Print Your Game

*   **Paper/Cardstock:** For best results, print cards on sturdy cardstock (e.g., 200-300 gsm or 80-110 lb cover). Tokens and game boards can also be printed on cardstock or mounted on thicker cardboard.
*   **Printer Settings:** Print at 100% scale (actual size). Ensure your printer is set to its best quality for clarity of text and art. Color printing is recommended for the full experience.
*   **Quantity:** Check the rulebook or PnP instructions for the number of copies needed for each sheet (especially for common cards or tokens).

## Step 3: Assemble Your Game

*   **Cutting:** Carefully cut out the cards and tokens using scissors, a hobby knife and ruler, or a paper guillotine.
*   **Sleeving (Recommended):** To protect your PnP cards and give them a better feel, consider sleeving them. You can insert the printed card along with a standard playing card (like a Magic: The Gathering or PokÃ©mon card) into a sleeve for added rigidity.
*   **Tokens & Boards:** Assemble any tokens or game board segments as per the PnP instructions.

## Step 4: Learn the Rules

*   The PnP package includes a comprehensive **Rulebook PDF**. Read this thoroughly to understand game setup, turn structure, card types, combat, and victory conditions.
*   *(A link to an online version of the rulebook or video tutorials will be added here when available.)*

## Step 5: Conquer the Galaxy!

You're all set! Gather your fellow commanders, choose your factions, and begin your journey to dominate the Eryxian Universe.
