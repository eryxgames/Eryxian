# ðŸŽ¨ For Designers: Crafting Your Eryxian Civilizations Cards

The Eryxian Universe thrives on creativity, and we envision a future where designers like you can actively contribute to the **Eryxian Civilizations Card Game** by crafting your own unique cards for the Print & Play (PnP) edition!

This page outlines our plans to support designers in bringing their visions to life within the Eryxian setting.

## The Vision: A Community-Crafted Card Pool

Our goal is to empower the community to expand the card game with new units, technologies, events, and artifacts that are consistent with the rich [Eryxian Universe lore](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki). Imagine unique faction-specific strategies emerging from community designs, or new neutral cards that add exciting tactical dimensions to gameplay.

## Planned Resources for Card Designers (Future Release)

To facilitate this, we plan to release the following resources:

1.  **Official Eryxian Card Game Rules & Lore Book (for Creators):**
    *   This comprehensive guide will detail the core game mechanics, card balancing principles, faction design philosophies, and key lore considerations necessary for creating thematically appropriate and mechanically sound cards.
    *   It will provide guidelines on how to translate concepts from the Eryxian Wiki into engaging card abilities.

2.  **Card Design Templates:**
    *   Professionally designed, high-resolution templates for various card types (Unit, Technology, Event, Artifact, Sector, etc.) will be provided.
    *   These templates will likely be available in common design software formats (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Affinity Designer, or even open-source alternatives like GIMP/Inkscape).
    *   They will include pre-defined areas for artwork, text, stats, icons, and faction branding to ensure visual consistency.

3.  **Asset Packs & Iconography:**
    *   A library of official Eryxian Universe icons (for resources, factions, keywords, etc.) and potentially background textures or design elements will be made available.

4.  **Artwork Generation & Sourcing Guidelines:**
    *   **Using Your Own Illustrations:** We encourage artists to create and use their own original artwork for their custom cards.
    *   **AI-Assisted Artwork (Guided):**
        *   We are exploring the development and release of **recommended LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models** specifically trained on Eryxian Universe aesthetics, species, and technological styles. These models, for use with AI image generation tools (like Stable Diffusion), would help create artwork that is thematically consistent with the Eryxian visual identity.
        *   Guidance will be provided on crafting effective prompts and ethical considerations when using AI for artwork.
    *   **Stock Art & Creative Commons:** Guidelines for sourcing appropriate public domain or Creative Commons artwork.

5.  **Community Showcase & Playtesting:**
    *   We plan to establish platforms (e.g., dedicated channels on Telegram/Discord, forums) for designers to share their custom card creations, receive feedback from the community, and organize playtesting sessions.
    *   Potentially, official "Community Card Spotlights" or even contests could see exceptional fan designs considered for inclusion in future official PnP releases (with full credit to the designer).

## Getting Started (Current State & Future)

*   **Currently:** The best way for designers to prepare is to immerse themselves in the [Eryxian Universe Wiki](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki). Understand the factions, technologies, creatures, and overall themes. Begin sketching out card ideas based on the existing lore.
*   **Future:** Once the Creator resources are released, you'll have all the tools you need to start designing, illustrating, and sharing your own Eryxian Civilizations cards.

We believe that the collective imagination of our community will lead to an incredibly diverse and exciting card pool for Eryxian Civilizations. Stay tuned for updates on these resources!
