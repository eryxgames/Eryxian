# ðŸŒ€ Factions of the Eryxian Universe

The Eryxian Universe is populated by a diverse array of sentient species and interstellar civilizations, each with its own history, motivations, and unique approach to the cosmos.

The **[Official Eryxian Wiki - Civilizations Page](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki/Eryxian-Civilizations)** provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on all major and minor factions.

**Legacy Faction Concepts (from earlier development, may be integrated or superseded by Wiki lore):**

*   **Aquatoids:** (Previously conceptualized as amphibious beings from Eryx's oceans. Current lore on Eryxia's oceans and the [Profundi](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki/Eryxian-World#c-the-profundi-the-deep-divers) Eryxians, or the [Cetacean Confluence](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki/Other-Civilizations#civilization-22-the-cetacean-confluence) may cover similar themes.)
*   **Zenithians:** (Previously conceptualized as an ancient machine race. The lore of [The Collective](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki/Eryxian-Civilizations#collective) and [The Ancients](https://github.com/eryxgames/eryxian/wiki/Eryxian-Civilizations#ancients) likely provides more current detail.)
*   **Cyreneans:** (Previously conceptualized as masters of fast interstellar travel and research. Elements of this may be found in various human factions or advanced alien species on the Wiki.)
