# Eryxian Labyrinth Research Interface - Inception

> The idea of the Labyrinths as localized pockets of physics-defying phenomena is a fantastic source for sci-fi mystery and adventure. An application to explore and generate these anomalies would be a perfect tool for a Game Master or a lore enthusiast.



### Notes

We will create also app for Eryxian Labyrinths research - we can discuss the subject more first. Labyrinths are phenomena, discovered on Eryxian (and different but conceptually similar phenomena on other planets of Eryxian Universe, like Gordian Moon). Labyrinths are relicts of ancient technology, and their physics paradoxical existence can lead to speculation they are "terminals", "control centers" or other components of huge planetery or stellar sized hyperstructures (this connects labyrinths to other hyperstructures even meridian disks). Main features of labyrinths are space-time paradoxes, quantum macroeffects, "absurd" termodynamics ard rules - even unique and different archtecture, some are more like labyrinths or illogical mazes (with sophisticated rules), som e have  different geometrical forms, some can be in forms of signals (Labyrinth Libraries) or other. How to present these ideas in an app (for game masters or readers curious about  this aspect of Eryxian Universe)? What is your suggestion, create several types in schematics (like in meridian disks app ) and demostrating GR/SR/QM "paradoxes" or rules, and generator to inspire game master for creating their own versions?
